# Voice-Controlled-Vehical-using-Arduino-Uno
This project demonstrates how to build a Voice-Controlled Vehicle using an Arduino Uno, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, an L298N motor driver, and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. The vehicle moves based on voice commands sent via a smartphone or Serial Monitor and stops automatically if an obstacle is detected within 20 cm.
